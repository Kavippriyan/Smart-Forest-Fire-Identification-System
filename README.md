# Smart-Forest-Fire-Identification-System

A fully automated system designed to detect forest fires early and initiate protective measures using real-time data from various sensors using LabVIEW software through the NIDAQmx Data Acquisition System.

The system included a gas sensor and a temperature sensor to monitor environmental conditions, along with a custom-built fire identification sensor utilizing an IR sensor to detect flames. As actuators, we integrated a water pump and a solenoid valve to take immediate action upon fire detection. The entire system was controlled via LabVIEW, with the integration of a programmable DC supply to ensure precise control of the actuators.
